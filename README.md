# MIS-395: AI-Powered Business Insights  
**Artificial Intelligence for Business**

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates the practical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to generate business insights across multiple domains. It simulates real-world decision-making scenarios by applying end-to-end AI pipelines using Python and other AI platforms.

**Title**: *AI-Powered Business Insights: Multidomain Analytics for Strategic Decision-Making*  
**Duration**: Week 3 ‚Äì Week 7  
**Team Size**: 3 students  
**Course**: MIS-395 ‚Äî Artificial Intelligence for Business

## üìÅ Datasets Used
We used 3 datasets from different business domains to ensure diversity and relevance:

1. **Bank Marketing Dataset** *(Marketing/Finance)* ‚Äì 100,000+ rows  
   > **Tools**: Python, Graphite Note, AWS PartyRock  
   > **Source**: [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)

2. **Bike Sales Dataset** *(Sales/Operations)*  
   > **Tools**: Python, Julius AI, Deepnote  
   > **Source**: [Kaggle Bike Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayavarman/bike-sales-data-of-100k)

3. **Employee Performance Dataset** *(HR Analytics)*  
   > **Tools**: Python, Graphite Note, Julius AI  
   > **Source**: [Kaggle Employee Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/employee-performance-and-productivity-data)

All datasets were cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality, consistency, and ethical use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Platforms
We implemented the project using combinations of the following tools:

- **Python**: Core scripting language for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization  
- **Graphite Note**: Automated modeling and business insight generation  
- **AWS PartyRock**: AI-powered interface for simulating business logic and predictions  
- **Julius AI**: Rapid data insight exploration and EDA  
- **Deepnote**: Collaborative Python notebook environment

## üîç Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and normalization
- Performed feature engineering and dimensionality checks

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized key trends and distributions
- Identified outliers and patterns
- Compared EDA results across different tools

### 3. Modeling
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Customer segmentation, trend detection, correlation analysis  
- **Predictive Modeling**: 
  - Classification: Predicting customer response (Bank Marketing)
  - Regression: Sales forecast (Bike Sales)
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
